    "\n",
    "**Supervised Learning** is a branch of Machine Learning where models are trained using **labeled data** — meaning each input has a known output.  \n",
    "The goal is to learn a mapping from **inputs (features)** to **outputs (targets)** so that the model can make accurate predictions on new, unseen data.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Characteristics\n",
    "- Works with **labeled datasets** (input + correct output).  \n",
    "- The model learns patterns between **X (features)** and **y (target)**.  \n",
    "- Used for both **classification** (predicting categories) and **regression** (predicting continuous values).  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Algorithms\n",
    "- **Linear Regression** — Predict continuous values.  \n",
    "- **Logistic Regression** — Binary classification (e.g., spam vs. not spam).  \n",
    "- **Decision Trees & Random Forests** — Handle complex, non-linear relationships.  \n",
    "- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)** — Find optimal boundaries between classes.  \n",
    "- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** — Classify based on similarity.  \n",

    "### Examples\n",
    "- Predicting **house prices** based on features (regression).  \n",

    "### Importance of Splitting the Dataset into Train & Test Sets\n",
    "\n",
    "Splitting a dataset into **training** and **testing** sets is a crucial step in supervised learning.  \n",
    "It ensures that your model learns from one portion of the data and is evaluated on **unseen data**, just like in real-world scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧠Why It’s Important\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Prevents Overfitting  \n",
    "If you train and test on the same data, the model memorizes patterns instead of learning them.  \n",
    "Testing on unseen data shows how well the model generalizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Gives a Realistic Performance Check  \n",
    "The test set simulates new data.  \n",
    "A good model performs well **both on training and test sets**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Helps Compare Algorithms Fairly  \n",
    "By using the same split, you can compare different models on identical test data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Detects Data Leakage  \n",
    "Keeping test data separate ensures no target information leaks into training, maintaining model reliability.\n",
